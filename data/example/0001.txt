Roger Norreis[a] (died between 1223 and 1225) was Abbot of Evesham in England.
He was a controversial figure, installed in several offices against opposition.
In his appointment to Evesham he was accused of immoral behaviour and failing to follow monastic rules.
In 1202 Norreis became embroiled in a dispute with his monks and his episcopal superior the Bishop of Worcester;
litigation and argumentation lasted until his deposition in 1213.
He then was appointed prior of a subsidiary monastic house of Evesham but was deposed within months, then re-appointed to the office five years later.
Norreis has been described by modern historians as being unsuited for the religious positions to which he was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role.
Nevertheless, even his most severe contemporary critic, Thomas of Marlborough, one of his own monks at Evesham, conceded that Norreis was energetic,
entertaining, and enterprising; during his time as abbot of Evesham Abbey he managed to complete the crossing tower of the monastic church.
Roger Norreis died between 1223 and 1225.
